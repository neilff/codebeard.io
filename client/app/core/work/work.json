It has the ability to do the following: find stores near the users location (GPS), find details of a specific product, find where the nearest store is that carries a specific product, search a specific store for a product, and save favourites for both stores and products.</p> <p>This project served as a learning project for me, it was completed over a weekend as I attempted to deep dive into AngularJS on mobile.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The idea behind Assist was simple: simplify the experience of joining adult recreational sports leagues. As a recreational hockey player myself, I found it a frustrating experience trying to work with my leagues website. Each year I had to re-register as a new player, and my statistics were never saved.</p><p>We decided to use hockey as the sport we want to manage, but kept in mind that this could be used for any recreational sport team. Each user would register once and each playerâ€™s statistics would be stored in detail. We wanted to provide users with a professional league-style website, capturing and providing as much detail as possible.</p><p>              The end result is Assist - a scalable, league management application. With this application we are able to create and score keep live hockey games. As games are documented in real time, the website reflects all of the gathered data. Player statistics are captured and are publicly accessible to all users.</p><p>For this project, I was responsible for designing many aspects, such as, the scorekeeping application, the live scoring updates, player and team profiles. </p>",
